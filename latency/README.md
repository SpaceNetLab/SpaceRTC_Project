# latency measurement

This dataset is measured from four popular RTC applications (i.e., Zoom, Google Meet, Cisco Webex and VooV) based on a number of controllable virtual hosts rented from virtual private server (VPS) providers. We continuously measured the sessions established by these applications for 20 days. Each column of the dataset indicates the date of measurement, application, locations of two end-hosts and one-way-frame latency of the session respectively.

(NOTE: The dataset of large-scale commercial videoconferencing sessions mentioned in our paper is not released due to the privacy policy.)
